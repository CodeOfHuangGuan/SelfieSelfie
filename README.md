# FrameTime
That Android+KeyGrip thing. On iOS.

## Building the project:
Android NDK should be extracted alongside the folder where you checked out this repository:

```
parent/
	android-ndk-r10d/
	FrameTime/
```

The main android project is being developed in the `SelfieSelfie/` directory. You can open it in Android Studio. Other Cinder projects were created along the way to test ideas on iOS.
